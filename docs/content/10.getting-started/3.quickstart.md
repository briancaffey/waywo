# Quickstart

This guide uses Docker Compose to bring up the full WAYWO stack. By the end, you will have the backend API, Celery workers, Redis, monitoring tools, and Jupyter Lab all running locally.

## Launch the Stack

::steps

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/briancaffey/waywo.git
cd waywo
```

### Configure environment variables

Open `docker-compose.yml` and update the AI model URLs in the `x-common-env` section to match your network:

```yaml
x-common-env: &common-env
  # ...
  EMBEDDING_URL: http://<your-embedding-host>:8000
  RERANK_URL: http://<your-rerank-host>:8111
  LLM_BASE_URL: http://<your-llm-host>:8002/v1
  LLM_MODEL_NAME: nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Nano-30B-A3B-BF16
```

::tip
If your models are running on the same machine as Docker, you can use `http://host.docker.internal:<port>` to reach them from inside the containers.
::

### Start the services

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Docker will build the application image, start Redis, run database migrations, and then launch all services. The first build may take a few minutes.

### Verify services are running

```bash
docker compose ps
```

You should see containers for `waywo-backend`, `waywo-celery-worker`, `waywo-celery-beat`, `waywo-redis-stack`, `waywo-flower`, `waywo-nat`, `waywo-phoenix`, and `waywo-jupyter` all in a healthy or running state.

## Service URLs

Once the stack is running, the following services are available:

| Service | URL | Purpose |
|---------|-----|---------|
| Backend API | [http://localhost:8008](http://localhost:8008) | FastAPI REST API |
| Swagger UI | [http://localhost:8008/docs](http://localhost:8008/docs) | Interactive API docs |
| ReDoc | [http://localhost:8008/redoc](http://localhost:8008/redoc) | Alternative API docs |
| Redis Insights | [http://localhost:7001](http://localhost:7001) | Redis browser and monitoring |
| Flower | [http://localhost:5555](http://localhost:5555) | Celery task monitoring |
| Jupyter Lab | [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888) | Interactive notebooks |
| Phoenix | [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006) | LLM observability and tracing |
| NAT Service | [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) | Nemotron Agent Toolkit |

::tip
The health check endpoint at [http://localhost:8008/api/health](http://localhost:8008/api/health) is a quick way to confirm the backend is responding.

## Useful Commands

```bash
# View logs from all services
docker compose logs -f

# View logs from a specific service
docker compose logs -f backend

# Restart a single service
docker compose restart backend

# Stop everything
docker compose down

# Stop and remove volumes (full reset)
docker compose down -v
```

## What is in `waywo.yml`?

The file `waywo.yml` at the project root defines which Hacker News "What are you working on?" threads to process. Each entry specifies a HN post ID, year, and month:

```yaml
- id: 46264491
  year: 2025
  month: 12

- id: 45869146
  year: 2025
  month: 11
```

The default configuration includes threads spanning from March 2022 to December 2025. You can add or remove entries to control which threads get ingested.

# Introduction

## The Problem

Every month, Hacker News publishes a "What are you working on?" thread where hundreds of makers share their side projects, startups, and experiments. These threads are goldmines of creative ideas, but they are essentially unsearchable. Comments are buried in flat lists, there is no structure, no tagging, and no way to find "that one project someone mentioned six months ago." Once a thread scrolls off the front page, those projects are lost to time.

## The Solution

WAYWO (What Are You Working On?) is an intelligent, searchable index that transforms these threads into structured, discoverable project data. It works through an automated pipeline:

1. **Scrape** -- Fetches monthly HN "What are you working on?" threads and their comments
2. **Extract** -- Uses NVIDIA Nemotron LLMs to parse each comment and extract structured project details (title, description, URLs, tech stack, hashtags)
3. **Validate & Score** -- AI validates whether a comment contains a real project and scores it for idea quality and complexity
4. **Embed** -- Generates 4096-dimensional vector embeddings for semantic understanding
5. **Search & Chat** -- Provides vector-based semantic search and a RAG chatbot to explore the project index conversationally

## Key Features

- **Automated HN Ingestion** -- Processes posts defined in `waywo.yml`, covering threads from 2022 to present
- **AI-Powered Extraction** -- NVIDIA Nemotron-3-Nano-30B extracts, validates, and scores projects from raw comment text
- **Semantic Search** -- Vector similarity search over project embeddings with reranking via llama-nemotron-rerank-1b
- **RAG Chatbot** -- Ask natural-language questions about projects and get grounded, cited answers
- **Full REST API** -- 45+ FastAPI endpoints covering posts, comments, projects, search, chat, admin, and workflow inspection
- **Nuxt 4 Frontend** -- Modern SPA with project browsing, filtering, bookmarking, search, and chat interfaces
- **Celery Task Queue** -- Async processing with Redis broker, Flower monitoring, and scheduled beat tasks
- **LLM Observability** -- Phoenix (Arize) tracing for full visibility into LLM calls and workflow execution
- **Jupyter Lab** -- Interactive notebooks for exploring the data and pipeline
- **Docker Compose** -- Single-command deployment of the entire stack

## Architecture Overview

WAYWO is composed of several services that run together via Docker Compose:

| Component | Technology | Role |
|-----------|-----------|------|
| Backend API | FastAPI + Uvicorn | REST API, orchestration |
| Task Queue | Celery + Redis | Async job processing |
| Database | SQLite + sqlite-vector | Projects, embeddings, vector search |
| Cache/Broker | Redis Stack | Celery broker, caching |
| LLM | NVIDIA Nemotron-3-Nano-30B | Project extraction, validation, chat |
| Embeddings | llama-embed-nemotron-8b | Vector embedding generation |
| Reranker | llama-nemotron-rerank-1b | Search result reranking |
| Frontend | Nuxt 4, shadcn/ui, Tailwind | User interface |
| Monitoring | Flower, Phoenix | Task and LLM observability |

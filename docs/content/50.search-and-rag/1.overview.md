# Search & RAG Overview

WAYWO provides two ways to query the project index. Both start from the same vector embeddings but serve different use cases.

## Semantic Search

A direct path from query text to ranked results.

1. User submits a natural-language query
2. Query is embedded into a 4096-dimensional vector via the NVIDIA embedding service
3. sqlite-vector performs cosine similarity against all project embeddings
4. Top-k results are returned with similarity scores (optionally reranked)

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/semantic-search`

```json
{
  "query": "real-time collaboration tools",
  "limit": 10,
  "use_rerank": true
}
```

Semantic search is fast and transparent -- you see the raw similarity scores and can page through results yourself.

## RAG Chatbot

A multi-stage pipeline that retrieves context and generates a natural-language answer.

1. User submits a question
2. Query is embedded via the same NVIDIA embedding service
3. Retrieves `top_k * 3` candidate projects via vector similarity
4. Reranker (llama-nemotron-rerank) scores each candidate against the query and keeps the best `top_k`
5. Nemotron LLM generates a conversational response grounded in the retrieved projects

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/waywo-chatbot`

```json
{
  "query": "What AI projects are people building?",
  "top_k": 5
}
```

The response includes both the generated text and the `source_projects` array so the frontend can link back to each referenced project.

## When to Use Each

| Scenario | Recommended Mode |
|----------|-----------------|
| Browsing and exploring projects by topic | Semantic Search |
| Filtering results with your own criteria | Semantic Search |
| Asking a specific question ("Are there any Rust CLI tools?") | RAG Chatbot |
| Getting a summarized overview of a topic area | RAG Chatbot |
| Programmatic integrations that need structured result lists | Semantic Search |

Both modes depend on the same prerequisites: a running embedding service, projects with stored embeddings, and (for best relevance) a running rerank service.

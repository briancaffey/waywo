# Data Designer Overview

The Data Designer is a synthetic data generation pipeline built on NVIDIA's [NeMo Data Designer](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Data-Designer) (NDD) library. It generates novel project ideas that look and feel like real Hacker News submissions -- complete with titles, descriptions, hashtags, and quality scores -- by learning from the patterns in existing project data.

## Why Synthetic Generation?

The WAYWO database contains thousands of projects extracted from real HN "What are you working on?" threads. The Data Designer extends this dataset by:

- **Exploring the idea space** -- Generating projects in tag combinations that don't yet exist in the database
- **Controlled creativity** -- Adjustable temperature lets users produce conservative variations or wild, novel concepts
- **Tag-guided generation** -- Users can seed generation with specific tags (e.g., "nutrition" + "ios") to explore intersections

## How It Works

The pipeline runs as a Celery task triggered from the Designer page in the frontend. It follows this flow:

```
User selects tags + options
  --> POST /api/generate-ideas (enqueues Celery task)
  --> Celery worker builds NDD pipeline
  --> NDD generates records via LLM
  --> Post-process: embed + save to SQLite
  --> Frontend polls for progress, displays results
```

Each generated record passes through a seven-column pipeline:

1. **primary_tag** -- Sampled from user's seed tags (or the full tag vocabulary)
2. **secondary_tags** -- Co-occurring tags sampled based on real tag relationships in the database
3. **target_audience** -- Random persona (indie hacker, data scientist, mobile dev, etc.)
4. **target_complexity** -- Uniform random 1--10
5. **project_idea** -- LLM generates a 2--3 paragraph idea incorporating all the above
6. **metadata** -- LLM extracts structured fields (title, short description, description, hashtags)
7. **idea_quality** -- LLM judge scores idea quality and complexity on 1--10 scales

## Multi-Tag Generation

When multiple seed tags are provided, the pipeline instructs the LLM to combine **all** tags into each idea rather than picking one at random. For example, seeding with "nutrition" and "ios" produces projects that blend both domains -- like a calorie-tracking app with CoreML food recognition.

## Generated vs. HN Projects

Generated projects are stored in the same `waywo_projects` table as HN-sourced projects, distinguished by the `source` column:

| Source Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `NULL` or `"hn"` | Extracted from a real HN comment |
| `"nemo_data_designer"` | Generated by the Data Designer pipeline |

Generated projects have `source_comment_id = NULL` (no HN comment to reference) but otherwise have the same fields: title, description, hashtags, scores, embeddings, and bookmarks. They appear in search results, the explore map, and the RAG chatbot alongside real projects.

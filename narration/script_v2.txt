One of my favorite corners of the Internet is a series of monthly posts on Hacker News called "What are you working on?"
People share their side projects, passion projects, web apps, and a wide variety of fascinating work.
I built Waywo as a tool to catalog, index, and research all of these projects, and I built it to run entirely locally using open models from NVIDIA.
The NVIDIA Nemotron family provides a complete set of tools for building agentic applications.
For language, there is Nemotron Nano, a compact model with strong reasoning that handles LLM inference throughout the system.
For retrieval, we use a Nemotron embedding model and a Nemotron rerank model to power retrieval augmented generation.
And for voice, NVIDIA Magpie handles speech synthesis while a Nemotron speech model handles voice recognition.
Waywo ingests projects from Hacker News using their public Firebase API, then processes each post through a series of steps in a LlamaIndex workflow.
Raw text submissions are cleaned, split into separate projects, researched, scored, tagged, and summarized by the Nemotron Nano model.
Repeat entries are deduplicated and low-effort responses are filtered out, so only substantive projects make it through.
An embedding for each project is created using the Nemotron embedding service, capturing a general understanding of what the project is about.
These embeddings power semantic search, reranking, agentic conversational chat, and advanced visualizations.
For semantic search, your search terms are transformed into embeddings and compared against all projects using distance metrics.
The most similar projects are then reranked using a model specifically tuned for reordering results by query relevance.
Nemotron Nano, with its strong reasoning capabilities, then gives you a high quality answer with references to the projects found during retrieval.
These same retrieval mechanisms power an agentic chatbot assistant that can answer any question about projects people have submitted.
The assistant uses retrieval augmented generation with vector embeddings inside a ReAct agent to find and reason about relevant projects.
A safety guardrail model keeps conversations focused on project information retrieval and blocks unrelated messages.
Waywo also supports full voice-to-voice interaction through a voice assistant.
Your speech is transcribed in real time by the Nemotron speech recognition model, and the response is read back to you using Magpie speech synthesis.
The result is a seamless, fully local, voice-to-voice agent experience.
Waywo can even produce short-form videos, directed by Nemotron, and narrated and captioned using the speech synthesis and voice recognition models.
The embeddings also enable advanced visualizations using techniques like UMAP and HDBSCAN.
These methods collapse high-dimensional embeddings into a two-dimensional space with meaningful clusters, letting you visually explore the landscape of what people are building.
Seeing so many projects from people all over the world can be genuinely inspiring.
And if you are struggling to come up with your own idea, Waywo can help you generate project concepts using the NeMo Data Designer.
This state-of-the-art data generation library produces high quality project descriptions based on your inputs, all powered by Nemotron Nano.
So go explore what the world is working on, and maybe find the spark for your next project.

# Narration App Plan

A mini app for generating voice narration from text using Dia (voice cloning) and Magpie (fast TTS). The goal is to produce ~3:30 of narrated audio composed of many individually generated segments, managed through a simple timeline UI.

## Services

| Service | Host | Use Case | Voice Cloning | Speed |
|---------|------|----------|---------------|-------|
| Dia | `192.168.5.253:7860` (configurable via `DIA_URL`) | Primary narration | Yes (from sample/Alice.wav) | Slow (~30-60s per segment) |
| Magpie | `192.168.6.3:9000` (configurable via `MAGPIE_URL`) | Quick drafts / previews | No (preset voices) | Fast (~2-5s per segment) |

## Data Model

### Segment (SQLite table: `segments`)

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| id | INTEGER PK | Auto-increment |
| position | INTEGER | Order in timeline (1-based) |
| text | TEXT | The narration text |
| sanitized_text | TEXT | Cleaned text sent to TTS |
| service | TEXT | "dia" or "magpie" |
| status | TEXT | "pending", "generating", "done", "error" |
| audio_path | TEXT | Relative path to WAV file in output/ |
| duration_seconds | REAL | Duration of generated audio |
| error_message | TEXT | Error details if failed |
| selected_variant_id | INTEGER | FK to active variant |
| created_at | DATETIME | |
| updated_at | DATETIME | |

### Variant (SQLite table: `variants`)

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| id | INTEGER PK | Auto-increment |
| segment_id | INTEGER FK | References segments.id |
| text | TEXT | Text used for this generation |
| sanitized_text | TEXT | Sanitized text sent to TTS |
| service | TEXT | Service used for generation |
| audio_path | TEXT | Path to WAV file |
| duration_seconds | REAL | Duration |
| created_at | DATETIME | |

## Text Sanitization (`sanitize.py`)

Applied automatically before sending to any TTS service:

- Curly single quotes → straight `'`
- Curly double quotes → straight `"`
- Remove parentheses and their contents
- En/em dashes → hyphen or comma
- Ellipsis character → `...`
- Strip `[S1]` / `[S2]` speaker tags (added back programmatically by Dia client)
- Collapse multiple spaces
- Strip leading/trailing whitespace

## Next Milestones

### Milestone 7: Projects
**Goal**: Introduce a project abstraction so each script import lives in its own workspace.

- [ ] Add `projects` table (id, name, description, created_at, updated_at)
- [ ] Add `project_id` FK to `segments` and `variants` tables
- [ ] `GET/POST /api/projects` — list and create projects
- [ ] `DELETE /api/projects/{id}` — delete project and all its segments/variants/audio files
- [ ] `POST /api/projects/{id}/import` — import script into a specific project
- [ ] UI: project switcher in the toolbar (dropdown or sidebar)
- [ ] UI: "New Project" creates a clean workspace
- [ ] UI: "Delete Project" removes everything (segments, variants, audio files)
- [ ] Importing a script into a new project does not affect other projects
- [ ] Output files organized by project: `output/{project_id}/`
- [ ] Migrate existing segments into a default project on first run

### Milestone 8: Voice Sample Management [DONE]
**Goal**: Support multiple voice samples and make it easy to experiment with different voices.

- [x] Add `voice_samples` table (id, name, audio_path, transcript, created_at)
- [x] Upload voice samples through the UI (WAV + transcript text)
- [x] Per-segment voice sample selection for Dia (dropdown in segment controls)
- [x] Per-segment Magpie voice selection (dropdown populated from `/api/voices`)
- [x] Preview a voice sample before using it (audio player in voice panel)
- [x] Ship with Alice as the default sample, allow adding more
- [x] Dia client accepts custom reference audio/text per segment
- [x] Voice samples panel with upload, list, preview, delete
- [x] Segments store `voice_sample_id` (Dia) and `magpie_voice` (Magpie)

### Milestone 9: Audio Post-Processing [DONE]
**Goal**: Improve exported audio quality with basic post-processing.

- [x] Configurable silence gap between segments (e.g. 0.5s, 1s, 1.5s)
- [x] Fade-in/fade-out per segment to avoid clicks at boundaries
- [x] Normalize audio levels across segments (peak or LUFS normalization)
- [x] Sample rate conversion so Dia (44.1kHz) and Magpie (22.05kHz) segments can be mixed in one export
- [x] Export as MP3 in addition to WAV (add `pydub` or `ffmpeg` dependency)

### Milestone 10: Generation Queue + Progress [DONE]
**Goal**: Better async generation with real-time progress updates.

- [x] WebSocket endpoint for real-time generation progress
- [x] UI updates live as each segment completes (no manual refresh)
- [x] Cancel in-progress generation
- [x] Retry failed segments with one click
- [x] Generation time estimates based on historical durations
- [x] Queue multiple generation requests instead of rejecting with 409

### Milestone 11: Article-to-Narration
**Goal**: Paste a full article and have it automatically split into TTS-friendly segments with LLM cleanup.

- [ ] `POST /api/projects/{id}/import-article` — accepts raw article text
- [ ] LLM-powered text processing (via Nemotron or configurable endpoint):
  - Split article into sentence-level segments appropriate for TTS
  - Sanitize special characters, abbreviations, numbers (e.g. "42%" -> "forty-two percent")
  - Expand acronyms where helpful for spoken clarity
  - Remove or rewrite content that does not work well spoken (URLs, markdown, code blocks)
- [ ] UI: "Import Article" option alongside "Import Script"
- [ ] Preview the split/cleaned segments before committing
- [ ] Configurable LLM endpoint via env var

### Milestone 12: Script Editor
**Goal**: A proper inline script editor that makes it easy to iterate on narration text.

- [ ] Multi-line script editing view (full script as editable text)
- [ ] Sync edits back to segments (diff-aware: only reset segments whose text changed)
- [ ] Line-by-line preview: click a line to hear existing audio or generate
- [ ] Sentence splitting helper: auto-split long lines into TTS-friendly chunks
- [ ] Character count / estimated duration per line
- [ ] Highlight lines that have issues (too long, unsupported characters)

### Milestone 12: Timeline Visualization
**Goal**: A visual timeline showing the full narration with waveforms and timing.

- [ ] Horizontal timeline bar showing all segments proportional to duration
- [ ] Color-coded by status (pending/done/error)
- [ ] Click a segment in the timeline to jump to it and play
- [ ] Continuous playback: play all segments in order without gaps
- [ ] Waveform display per segment (using Web Audio API)
- [ ] Total duration marker and current playback position

## Configuration

All via environment variables with sensible defaults:

```
DIA_URL=http://192.168.5.253:7860
MAGPIE_URL=http://192.168.6.3:9000
REFERENCE_AUDIO=sample/Alice.wav
REFERENCE_TEXT=sample/text.txt
OUTPUT_DIR=output
DATABASE_URL=narration.db
```

## Running

```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Start the server
uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8877

# Or batch generate from CLI
uv run python batch.py script.txt --service dia
```

## Notes

- Dia requires the `[S1]` tag in the reference text and generates with the segment text + `[S2]` suffix (prevents audio cutoff)
- Each segment should be roughly 1-2 sentences — the TTS services struggle with longer text
- The existing `script.txt` has 27 non-empty lines, which at ~7-8 seconds each gives roughly 3:30 of audio
- The original `generate.py` and `sample.py` are preserved as reference but won't be used by the app

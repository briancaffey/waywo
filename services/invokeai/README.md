# InvokeAI

The code provided here is an example of how to use the InvokeAI program to generate images from text prompts using the InvokeAI API.

Do not write any code in this directory, you should just read what is here and use it as guidance.

`sample.py` contains an example of how I have built a client for InvokeAI in another project.

## Example Graph

`flux_2_klein_invokeai_graph.json` contains an example graph. We will need use this instead of what is currently used in `sample.py`

This graph contains a simple text-to-image workflow.

`flux_2_klein_ref_image_invokeai_graph.json` is another workflow that contains image-to-image generation using a reference image.
